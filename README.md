so ill be leaving for school legit today ill drop my sigma coding methods.  

scripts used 

hydroxide (aka better remote spy)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigmaBoy/hydroxide/refs/heads/main/gui'),true))()````  

inf yeild (only for dex usefull for flight or smth ig)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'),true))()````  

dex (for finding local scripts n shit)                      
````loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infyiff/backup/main/dex.lua"))()````  
  
weird dex like thing i made (for grabing local scripts n shit)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigmaBoy/WeirdDex/refs/heads/main/gui'),true))()````  
## steps
join ur fuckass game and use hydroxide to find remotes and just send them bitches to "https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat"  
tell the ai what the remotes do and tell it what you want the script ur making to do  
if the ai is too dumb to understand it use hydroxide right click the remote and click copy script path and use dex to find and copy the script and just send that shit to the ai.  

alternatively use the dex to find a file such as "weapon logic" or some shit and then u can use the weird dex to copy all the local scripts childed to that file (good if ur lazy like me)  

thats basicly it. 

## try it yourself

ill list some games and what you need to make.  
````https://www.roblox.com/games/133705272470942/Gun-Simulator````  
okay so i need you to make a script that would:  
automaticly train                 (if ur feeling advanced make it be able to train in all worlds at all stations)    
automaticly shoot to get trophies (if ur feeling advanced make it be able to auto shoot in all worlds)
