so ill be leaving for school legit today ill drop my sigma coding methods.  

scripts used 

hydroxide (aka better remote spy)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigmaBoy/hydroxide/refs/heads/main/gui'),true))()````  

inf yeild (only for dex usefull for flight or smth ig)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'),true))()````  

dex (for finding local scripts n shit)                      
````loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infyiff/backup/main/dex.lua"))()````  
  
weird dex like thing i made (for grabing local scripts n shit)  
````loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nigmaBoy/WeirdDex/refs/heads/main/gui'),true))()````  
## steps
join ur fuckass game and use hydroxide to find remotes and just send them bitches to "https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat"  
tell the ai what the remotes do and tell it what you want the script ur making to do  
if the ai is too dumb to understand it use hydroxide right click the remote and click copy script path and use dex to find and copy the script and just send that shit to the ai.  

alternatively use the dex to find a file such as "weapon logic" or some shit and then u can use the weird dex to copy all the local scripts childed to that file (good if ur lazy like me)  

thats basicly it.   

## try it yourself  

ill list some games and what you need to make.    
````https://www.roblox.com/games/133705272470942/Gun-Simulator````    
okay so i need you to make a script that would:    
* have a gui with toggles (please)  
* automaticly train                    
* automaticly shoot to get trophies

if ur feeling advanced make it be able to train/shoot in all worlds at all stations

  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  use remotes

i also coded a little thing for this game take a look [gun game script](https://github.com/nigmaBoy/how-to-scripting/blob/main/gun%20game%20script)  



lets say you wanna do something thats a bit harder. try mineplay.  
````https://www.roblox.com/games/16333718768/Mineplay-Crossplay-NEW-BLOCKS````  
for this game we will be making a auto art builder.     
what to do:  
* figure out how to place blocks    
* figure out what blocks are what and how to tell 1 block apart from the other    
* figure out what blocks to use when building (i recomend starting with wool or clay blocks)    
* just send the ai a pic of the blocks ur using and what each block is called in the files it'le figure it out  
* tell the ai to make a auto builder that takes the file type ur using and makes it into a 10x10 pixle art  

#### important before u start  
figure out what file type u will be using (awp has a png decompresser other executors dont)    
personaly i use BMP images u can use whatever (some img are compressed which means u cant use them)  

<details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>
  use remotes 
  
  use this [bmp](https://www.freeconvert.com/png-to-bmp) img maker  
</details>

i made my own thing here [mineplay thing](https://github.com/nigmaBoy/how-to-scripting/blob/main/mineplay%20thing)  





much love thatonedudetsts
